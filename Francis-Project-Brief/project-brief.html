          <p class="project-des">The purpose of this project is to redesign the current guild website to 
            better serve both the guild officers while teaching new players and by use of veteran guild 
            players to learn and build their characters to the current best design.

              <h2>Business Needs</h2>
              <p>Guilds within World of Warcraft survive by two means, having guildies to “fill” the guild 
                with total number of players and by guild activity, which is rated on major game sites such 
                as Raider.IO. The success of this rebuild will help draw players to the guild and help active 
                players build their characters to achieve higher guild activities through successful wins in 
                Raiding, Mythic Dungeons, and Player vs Player battles.

              <h2>Use Cases</h2>
              <p>As a teaching guild, many new players come to us to provide the most recent informaiton and 
                charcater builds to allow them to compete with veteran players. Currently, many new updated 
                systems have been deployed onto the game and an entire new expansion is scheduled to be 
                released later this year. Many websites, including ours, is out of date and detailed information 
                on the new expansion is difficult to locate.

              <h2>Success Measures</h2>
              <p>The product will be measured on the number of users and how often the users interact with the 
                site. Additionally, site users will be periodically questioned through the guild’s discord to 
                evaluate the users experiences witht he site and aquire informaiton for potential changes and 
                issues. Value of the website will be measured on the guild’s rating involving the website and 
                it’s informaiton.

              <h2>Risks</h2>
              <p>There are no major risks involved with building this website. The cost of the build is incorporated 
                into the site build time, which is neglegable. The time line for the website is more than reasonable 
                even with the guild requesting the site be completed as soon as possible.

              <h2>Stakeholders and Users</h2>
              <p>Stakeholders are the senior guild officers: Anna (Guild Master), Phil (CO - Guild Master), and Keith 
                (Guilds Webmaster). <br>
                Target Users are the guild officers who train new players and veteran players looking to improve their 
                character builds. Their motivation is to build their chosen character to a point in which they are 
                competitive against other veteran players and become more adapt to high end raiding and mythic dungeons.

              <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
              <p>- Consolidate officer pages and character build pages to single source pages.
                - Update character builds to include corruption traits and ideal azerite traits.
                - Build pages to incorporate informaition for Shadowlands areas, covenants, and dungeons.

              <h2>Competitor</h2>
              <p>The primary competitor for this site will be wowhead.com. This site has a number of strengths including 
                detailed informaiton about various items, quests, traits, gear, maps, etc. It has been a long time goto 
                for players seeking information, however, the site does not contain any focus point and as a result, 
                informaiton can be difficult to locate in a timely fashion, more relevant information is often found 
                across several web pages, and the information may not always supply the best options for players seeking 
                current best knowledge.
